# TouchSensor Arduino Library

The **TouchSensor** library provides a simple and reliable way to interface with capacitive touch modules like the **TTP223** using Arduino boards. With built-in debounce and edge detection, this library is ideal for touch-based input in interactive electronics, smart switches, and DIY projects.

---

## 🔧 Supported Hardware

- **TTP223 capacitive touch sensor**
- Any other capacitive touch sensor with a digital output pin
- Works with all Arduino-compatible boards (Uno, Nano, Mega, ESP32, etc.)

---

## ✨ Features

- 📲 **Touch detection** via simple `.isTouched()` function
- ⏱️ **Built-in debounce** support to avoid false multiple triggers
- 🔁 **Edge detection**:
  - `.justTouched()` — true only on the transition from not touched to touched
  - `.justReleased()` — true only on the transition from touched to not touched
- 🧠 **Clean abstraction** over `digitalRead()` with enhanced control
- ⚡ **Lightweight** and fast: minimal memory and CPU usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Installation**

You can install this library by:
- Downloading the ZIP from GitHub and adding it via **Arduino IDE > Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library**
- Or placing it in your `Arduino/libraries` folder manually

### 2. **Wiring Example (TTP223)**

| TTP223 Pin | Connect To        |
|------------|-------------------|
| VCC        | 3.3V or 5V (Arduino) |
| GND        | GND (Arduino)     |
| OUT        | Digital Pin (e.g., D2) |

---

## 💻 Example Code

```cpp
#include <TouchSensor.h>

TouchSensor touch(2);  // TTP223 sensor connected to digital pin 2

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  touch.update();  // Always call this first to refresh sensor state

  if (touch.isTouched()) {
    Serial.println("Currently being touched");
  }

  if (touch.justTouched()) {
    Serial.println("Touch started");
  }

  if (touch.justReleased()) {
    Serial.println("Touch ended");
  }

  delay(50);  // Adjust debounce timing if needed
}
🧪 Applications
Capacitive touch light switch

Smart home control panels

Secret keypad (touch-based password input)

Contactless interfaces in public devices

DIY electronics and Arduino projects

🛠️ Advanced Tips
To make your sensor more or less sensitive, try:

Increasing the grounding around the sensor pad

Adding a resistor (~1MΩ) between OUT and GND for stability

Works well with interrupts if .update() is moved into an ISR-safe structure
